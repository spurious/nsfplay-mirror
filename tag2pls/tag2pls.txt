DESCRIPTION

    Tag2pls is a command-line taginfo to playlist converter. It can
    accept taginfo files generated by NSFplug or NSFMeasure. The
    playlists generated from this software can only be accepted by
    NSFplug for Winamp2.xx.

    Tag2pls extracts title and play-time information of FILENAME.NSF
    from the corresponding taginfo file (FILENAME.TAG or TAGINFO.TAG),
    then tag2pls prints the playlist file for the FILENAME.NSF to the
    standard output.

    The file TAGINFO.TAG or FILENAME.TAG must be located in the same
    folder together with the FILENAME.NSF (Note that TAGINFO.TAG is
    ignored if FILENAME.TAG exists). If not, tag2pls do not generate
    any play-time information.

    If the option -f is given, the existing title information in the
    taginfo file is ignored. Then, tag2pls generates the title section
    of the playlist according to the specified format. The format text
    may include the control characters that replaced with the following
    information.

    %T  The title of the song.
    %A  The artist name of the song.
    %C  The copyright text of the song.
    %n  The current number of the song.
    %e  The number of songs in the NSF.
    %s  The start number of the songs.
    %N  The current number of the song in the hex format.
    %E  The number of songs in the NSF in the hex format.
    %S  The start number of the songs in the hex format.

    The default format is "%A - %T (%n/%e)".

DIAGNOSTICS
  
    Tag2pls exits with the exit status non-zero if an error occurred.
    Otherwise, it exits with the status zero.
