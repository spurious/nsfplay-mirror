To Do:

Emu:
- streemerz support > apparently illegal opcodes are not supported
- full-emulation quality option (emulate at M2 speed and downsample)
- Replace all pcounter with clock based simulation, separate tick/render (todo FDS)
- Rewrite 5B implementation for better synchronization with clock (is currently independent of clock).
- N163 horrible sound accuracy
- N163 volume vs num channels
- VRC7 emulation accuracy
- FDS high frequency modulation behaviour, verify against hardware
- MMC5 squares, are they nonlinear, does PCM affect them?
Format:
- NSF2
UI:
- Breakout window for info (nice for looking at NSFe text chunk).
- Dendy mode options (consider adding a dendy mode to format? maybe save for NSF2)
- Vertical stacking for multiple key dots on same pitch?
- Command line wav could use fade out (actually set config param, also channel mask option).
- Command line wave have an option that temporarily sets a config value and restores it later (can use for fades, channel mask)
- One click button for keyboard view?
- Visualizer plugin system.
Other:
- Dendy support: option for dendy override and possibly wrong duty cycle bug?
- during 5s fadeout seems to be a quiet 60hz buzz
- wider resample window? (i.e. multi-lobe sinc?)
- Foobar2000 plugin?
- Improve loop detection
- Fix init time allowance to be an actual 1s.
- Battletoads track 10, noise sounds much duller on hardware.
- More speed control options in keyboard view: pitch adjust, fast playback
- Play speed override option (keyboard adjustment should have more than just 1-8 integers).
- See Predator NSF, starts at 8, moving down to a low track then moving up goes back to 8. When moving past end, wraps to 8.
- Behaviour with 2 NSFs in a playlist is counterintuitive.
- Bus/stack plugins: register trace, NSF validator, other export tools
- Invert L/R of each channel for rushjet.
Not sure how:
- Mac/Linux versions?
- Channel mask caption is ????? in Japanese UI.
- Settings Apply/Cacel buttons are ????? in Japanese UI.
- Settings audio quality panel has ????? at bottom in Japanese UI.
