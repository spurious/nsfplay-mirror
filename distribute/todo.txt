TODO
- Review write order / masking / return value and try to prevent conflict with FDS-RAM $8000-DFFF.
- N163 horrible sound accuracy
- N163 volume vs num channels
- User option for VRC7 patches
- VRC6 too loud, match with Famitracker
- VRC6 test polarity / channel balance / etc.
- Frame sequencer and $4017 response, make MMC5 sequencer independent
- Loop detector - should not set length if loop found; should not conflict with NSFe/playlist lengths

TODO LATER
- Vertical stacking for multiple key dots on same pitch?
- Command line wav could use fade out (actually set config param, also channel mask option).
- Command line wave have an option that temporarily sets a config value and restores it later (can use for fades, channel mask)
- One click button for keyboard view?
- NSF2
- Foobar2000 plugin?
- VRC7 accuracy
- Improve loop detection
- Fix init time allowance to be an actual 1s.
- Battletoads track 10, noise sounds much duller on hardware.
- Doommaster has pitch problem, also seems to have weird buffer cutting stuff, only in NSFPlay?
- 5B match volume envelope to real thing? (does not match datasheet, current waveform too sharp)
- Channel mask caption is ????? in Japanese UI.
- Settings Apply/Cacel buttons are ????? in Japanese UI.
- Settings audio quality panel has ????? at bottom in Japanese UI.
- APU2 option panel says "Option" instead of "Options"? Make consistent.
