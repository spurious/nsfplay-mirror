TODO
- Review write order / masking / return value and try to prevent conflict with FDS-RAM $8000-DFFF.
- Vertical stacking for multiple key dots on same pitch?
- Command line wav could use fade out (actually set config param, also channel mask option).
- Command line wave have an option that temporarily sets a config value and restores it later (can use for fades, channel mask)
- One click button for keyboard view?
- NSFE
- NSF2
- Debug trace code
- Randomize RAM option
- N163 horrible sound accuracy (maybe later)
- N163 volume vs num channels
- User option for VRC7 patches
- VRC7 correct patches
- Improve loop detection
- Fix init time allowance to be an actual 1s.
- APU2 option panel says "Option" instead of "Options"? Make consistent.
- Battletoads track 10, noise sounds much duller on hardware.
- Remove playlist manipulation stuff / save length / etc. ; seems to be crashy?
- Doommaster has pitch problem, also seems to have weird buffer cutting stuff, only in NSFPlay?
- 5B envelope seems to update a little bit later than emulated (does it update only on next step? Nestopia seems to have it right)
- Foobar2000 plugin
- MMC5 double speed length counter, envelope, make it independent of 4017/frame sequencer.
- MMC5 PCM mixing, should be same as APU2 nonlinear but goes to twice the input volume
- MMC5 invert polarity of output
- Unmute on reset option for MMC5?
- 5B polarity is reversed
- Set more accurate levels for all expansions
