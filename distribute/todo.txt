To Do:

Emu:
- full-emulation quality option (emulate at M2 speed and downsample)
- Rewrite 5B implementation for better synchronization with clock (is currently independent of clock).
- N163 horrible sound accuracy
- N163 volume vs num channels
- VRC7 emulation accuracy
- MMC5 squares, are they nonlinear, does PCM affect them?
- Battletoads track 10, noise sounds much duller on hardware.
- Triangle phase randomize init option.
- Triangle at freq 0 creates audible high frequency tone? Is this accurate? See Silver Surfer ends of tracks.
UI:
- Breakout window for info (nice for looking at NSFe text chunk).
- Swapped duty for APU1 panel
- UI for "REGION" setting 0="auto"(use 0 bit), 1=prefer pal, 2=prefer ntsc, 3=force pal, 4=force ntsc, 5=force dendy
- UI for FDS options (old options gone, new cutoff option)
- Vertical stacking for multiple key dots on same pitch?
- Command line wav could use fade out (actually set config param, also channel mask option).
- Command line wave have an option that temporarily sets a config value and restores it later (can use for fades, channel mask)
- One click button for keyboard view?
- Infobox song position needs to be synched with true song position on open.
- Document logging feature (LOG_CPU, LOG_CPU_FILE), add UI for it
Other:
- during 5s fadeout seems to be a quiet 60hz buzz
- Play speed override option (keyboard adjustment should have more than just 1-8 integers), maybe allow CPU speed adjustment too?
- See Predator NSF, starts at 8, moving down to a low track then moving up goes back to 8. When moving past end, wraps to 8.
- Behaviour with 2 NSFs in a playlist is counterintuitive.
- Invert L/R of each channel for rushjet.

Later version:
- Bus/stack plugins: NSF validator, other export tools
- Improve loop detection
- APU debug pin emulation
- wider resample window? (i.e. multi-lobe sinc?)
- Mac/Linux versions?
- Foobar2000 plugin
- KB plugin
- NSF2
- Visualizer plugin system. Full register view capability.
- De-MFC GUI, change to a .lib, and build directly into plugin.
- Remove plugin stubs from xgm, these belong in the plugin project itself.
- Consider adding a dendy mode to format? maybe save for NSF2?

NSFs:
- Sesame Street Countdown does not play. Bad rip?

NSF validation / debug log:
- maybe just build into register logger
- VRC7 speed limit
- illegal opcodes
- IRQ usage
- FDS vs other expansions
- log play/init events
- log all writes, APU writes
- log all reads. etc.
- instruction trace?
- list expansions and other NSF header info
- writes to register mirrors

Unknown:
- Channel mask caption is ????? in Japanese UI.
- Settings Apply/Cacel buttons are ????? in Japanese UI.
- Settings audio quality panel has ????? at bottom in Japanese UI.
