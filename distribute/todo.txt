To do:

NSPlay 2.3 features to finish:
- Emu: Rebalance APU1 vs APU2 (suspect APU2 may be to loud?)
- Emu: Redo 5B and VRC6 volume balance, get the defaults to 128.
- Emu: VRC6/VRC7 volumes need to be 128ed.
- Emu: Triangle at freq 0 creates audible high frequency tone? Is this accurate? See Silver Surfer ends of tracks.
- UI: for "REGION" setting 0="auto"(use 0 bit), 1=prefer pal, 2=prefer ntsc, 3=force pal, 4=force ntsc, 5=force dendy
- Emu: during 5s fadeout seems to be a quiet 60hz buzz
- UI: Test Japanese UI

Emu:
- full-emulation quality option (emulate at M2 speed and downsample)
- Rewrite 5B implementation for better synchronization with clock (is currently independent of clock).
- VRC7 emulation accuracy
- MMC5 squares, are they nonlinear, does PCM affect them?
- Battletoads track 10, noise sounds much duller on hardware.
- Triangle phase randomize init option.
UI:
- Command line wav could use fade out (actually set config param, also channel mask option).
- Command line wave have an option that temporarily sets a config value and restores it later (can use for fades, channel mask)
Other:
- Play speed override option (keyboard adjustment should have more than just 1-8 integers), maybe allow CPU speed adjustment too?

Later version:
- Bus/stack plugins: NSF validator, other export tools
- Improve loop detection
- APU debug pin emulation
- wider resample window? (i.e. multi-lobe sinc?)
- Mac/Linux versions?
- Foobar2000 plugin
- KB plugin
- NSF2
- Visualizer plugin system. Full register view capability.
- De-MFC GUI, change to a .lib, and build directly into plugin.
- Remove plugin stubs from xgm, these belong in the plugin project itself.
- Consider adding a dendy mode to format? maybe save for NSF2?
- Breakout window for info (nice for looking at NSFe text chunk).
- One click button for keyboard view?
- Vertical stacking for multiple key dots on same pitch?
- Other: Infobox song position needs to be synched with true song position on open. (pass, this is a mess)
- Other: Behaviour with 2 NSFs in a playlist is counterintuitive.

NSFs:
- Sesame Street Countdown does not play. Bad rip?

NSF validation:
- VRC7 speed limit? (hard)
- illegal opcodes
- IRQ usage
- FDS vs other expansions
- writes to register mirrors

Unknown:
- Channel mask caption is ????? in Japanese UI.
- Settings Apply/Cacel buttons are ????? in Japanese UI.
- Settings audio quality panel has ????? at bottom in Japanese UI.
