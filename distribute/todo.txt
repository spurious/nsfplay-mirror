TODO
- Vertical stacking for multiple key dots on same pitch.

- NSFE
- NSF2
- Debug trace code
- Randomize RAM option
- N163 horrible sound accuracy (maybe later)
- N163 volume vs num channels
- User option for VRC7 patches

- Fix init time allowance to be an actual 1s.
- Unmute on reset option for MMC5?
- APU2 option panel says "Option" instead of "Options"? Make consistent.
- Battletoads track 10, noise sounds much duller on hardware.
- Remove playlist manipulation stuff / save length / etc. ; seems to be crashy?
