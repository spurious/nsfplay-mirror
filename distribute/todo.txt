RELEASE

To Do:
- Frame sequencer and $4017 response, make MMC5 sequencer independent
- Breakout window for info (nice for looking at NSFe text chunk).
- VRC6 square phase reset should not reset divide
- Replace all pcounter with clock based simulation (except for VRC7)
- N163 horrible sound accuracy
- N163 volume vs num channels
- Vertical stacking for multiple key dots on same pitch?
- Command line wav could use fade out (actually set config param, also channel mask option).
- Command line wave have an option that temporarily sets a config value and restores it later (can use for fades, channel mask)
- One click button for keyboard view?
- NSF2
- Foobar2000 plugin?
- VRC7 emulation accuracy
- FDS high frequency modulation behaviour, verify against hardware
- MMC5 squares, are they nonlinear, does PCM affect them?
- Improve loop detection
- Fix init time allowance to be an actual 1s.
- Battletoads track 10, noise sounds much duller on hardware.
- APU2 option panel says "Option" instead of "Options"? Make consistent.
- More speed control options in keyboard view: pitch adjust, fast playback
- Play speed override option.
- Visualizer plugin system.
- See Predator NSF, starts at 8, moving down to a low track then moving up goes back to 8. When moving past end, wraps to 8.
- Behaviour with 2 NSFs in a playlist is counterintuitive.
- Bus/stack plugins: register trace, NSF validator, other export tools

Unknown:
- Doommaster had weird pitch and cutting problems. Are these still there?
- Channel mask caption is ????? in Japanese UI.
- Settings Apply/Cacel buttons are ????? in Japanese UI.
- Settings audio quality panel has ????? at bottom in Japanese UI.
