Emu:
- full-emulation quality option (emulate at M2 speed and downsample)
- Rewrite 5B implementation for better synchronization with clock (is currently independent of clock).
- VRC7 emulation accuracy
- MMC5 squares, are they nonlinear, does PCM affect them?
- Battletoads track 10, noise sounds much duller on hardware.
- Triangle phase randomize init option.
- Better anti-click fadeoff?
- Play Metroid FDS 33 on hardware, make sure that wrapping is correct.
- Conversion of float to int, use _controlfp? or floor if offline precalc
- N163 bad-emulation options (old-length, no-phase write)
UI:
- Command line wav could use fade out (actually set config param, also channel mask option).
- Command line wave have an option that temporarily sets a config value and restores it later (can use for fades, channel mask)
Other:
- Play speed override option (keyboard adjustment should have more than just 1-8 integers), maybe allow CPU speed adjustment too?
- FDS write protect > default on if multi-chip
- suppress DMC pop if done in INIT (do one sample of output from mixer before play, then stick result in highpass DC filter)
- disable auto-skip on 1 track NSFs by default
- Infinite playtime option
- OPL2 notes, may help VRC7 implementation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18IGx18NQY_Q1PJVZ-bHywao9bhsDoAqoIn1rIm42nwo


Later version:
- Sound device selection.
- Bus/stack plugins: NSF validator, other export tools
- Improve loop detection
- APU debug pin emulation
- wider resample window? (i.e. multi-lobe sinc?)
- Mac/Linux versions?
- Foobar2000 plugin
- KB plugin
- NSF2
- Visualizer plugin system. Full register view capability.
- De-MFC GUI, change to a .lib, and build directly into plugin.
- Remove plugin stubs from xgm, these belong in the plugin project itself.
- Consider adding a dendy mode to format? maybe save for NSF2?
- Breakout window for info (nice for looking at NSFe text chunk).
- One click button for keyboard view?
- Vertical stacking for multiple key dots on same pitch?
- Other: Infobox song position needs to be synched with true song position on open. (pass, this is a mess)
- Other: Behaviour with 2 NSFs in a playlist is counterintuitive.
- Always On Top > wxSTAY_ON_TOP on wxFrame?

NSFs:
- Sesame Street Countdown does not play. Bad rip?

NSF validation:
- VRC7 speed limit? (hard)
- illegal opcodes
- IRQ usage
- FDS vs other expansions
- writes to register mirrors
