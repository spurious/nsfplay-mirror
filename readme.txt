NSFPlay/NSFPlug 2.3 source code 7/19/2013

This code is maintained by Brad Smith. It is a fork of NSFPlay/NSFPlug by Brezza. The latest version should be available at:
- http://code.google.com/p/nsfplay/
- http://rainwarrior.ca/projects/nsfplay/

This code contains several modifications to original, see nsfplay.txt for a list of changes.

To debug, select NSFPlay as your startup project and set $(OutDir) as your working directory. There is a Setup.bat which will copy the default in_yansf.ini to your Debug/Release temporary folders. I hope to eliminate the need for a default in_yansf.ini in future versions of the program.

I have presumed based on text comments and readme files in the original code that it is distributed freely, and modification and redistribution is permitted. The same permissive license applies to this version of the code I maintain. You may reuse this code without restriction, and no warranty or liability is implied on my part.

Feel free to contact me with questions or comments.
